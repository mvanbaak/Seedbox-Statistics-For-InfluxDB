**Seedbox Statistics For Influxdb**
------------------------------

![Screenshot](https://puu.sh/ttcxJ/2919760fa3.PNG)

This tool will allow you to send stats from a torrent client to InfluxDB for displaying in Grafana

**Support Clients**
* Deluge
* uTorrent
* rTorrent
* transmission

## Usage

Before the first use run pip3 install -r requirements.txt

Enter your desired information in config.ini and run influxdbSeedbox.py

Optionally, you can specify the --config argument to load the config file from a different location.  


## Notes About Specific Clients

**Deluge**
* You must have the WebUI plugin installed.
* The URL to use in the config will usually look like: http://ADDRESS:8112/json
* Only the password is required in the config.ini

**uTorrent**
* You must have the Web Interface enabled with a Username/Password set
* The URL to use in the config will usually look like: http://localhost:8080/gui
* You must have both a username and password in the config

**rTorrent**
* Neither username or password are needed in the config
* URL can very depending on configuration

**transmission**
* Neither username or password are needed in the config (depending on configuration)
* URL is the ip address/hostname where transmission is running

rTorrent is tricky since you need something to forward the SCGI requests. For my testing I used nginx to forward requests on port 8000
Setting this up is beyond the scope of this tool. 
However, you can refer to [this guide](http://elektito.com/2016/02/10/rtorrent-xmlrpc/)
